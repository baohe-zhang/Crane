However
little
known
the
feelings
or
views
of
such
a
man
may
be
on
his
first
entering
a
neighbourhood,
this
truth
is
so
well
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
surrounding
families,
that
he
is
considered
the
rightful
property
of
some
one
or
other
of
their
daughters.
"My
dear
Mr.
Bennet."
said
his
lady
to
him
one
day,
"have
you
heard
that
Netherfield
Park
is
let
at
last?"
Mr.
Bennet
replied
that
he
had
not.
"But
it
is."
returned
she;
"for
Mrs.
Long
has
just
been
here,
and
she
told
me
all
about
it."
Mr.
Bennet
made
no
answer.
"Do
you
not
want
to
know
who
has
taken
it?"
cried
his
wife
impatiently.
"_You_
want
to
tell
me,
and
I
have
no
objection
to
hearing
it."
This
was
invitation
enough.
"Why,
my
dear,
you
must
know,
Mrs.
Long
says
that
Netherfield
is
taken
by
a
young
man
of
large
fortune
from
the
north
of
England;
that
he
came
down
on
Monday
in
a
chaise
and
four
to
see
the
place,
and
was
so
much
delighted
with
it,
that
he
agreed
with
Mr.
Morris
immediately;
that
he
is
to
take
possession
before
Michaelmas,
and
some
of
his
servants
are
to
be
in
the
house
by
the
end
of
next
week."
"What
is
his
name?"
"Bingley."
"Is
he
married
or
single?"
"Oh!
Single,
my
dear,
to
be
sure!
A
single
man
of
large
fortune;
four
or
five
thousand
a
year.
What
a
fine
thing
for
our
girls."
"How
so?
How
can
it
affect
them?"
"My
dear
Mr.
Bennet."
replied
his
wife,
"how
can
you
be
so
tiresome!
You
must
know
that
I
am
thinking
of
his
marrying
one
of
them."
"Is
that
his
design
in
settling
here?"
"Design!
Nonsense,
how
can
you
talk
so!
But
it
is
very
likely
that
he
_may_
fall
in
love
with
one
of
them,
and
therefore
you
must
visit
him
as
soon
as
he
comes."
"I
see
no
occasion
for
that.
You
and
the
girls
may
go,
or
you
may
send
them
by
themselves,
which
perhaps
will
be
still
better,
for
as
you
are
as
handsome
as
any
of
them,
Mr.
Bingley
may
like
you
the
best
of
the
party."
"My
dear,
you
flatter
me.
I
certainly
_have_
had
my
share
of
beauty,
but
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
anything
extraordinary
now.
When
a
woman
has
five
grown-up
daughters,
she
ought
to
give
over
thinking
of
her
own
beauty."
"In
such
cases,
a
woman
has
not
often
much
beauty
to
think
of."
"But,
my
dear,
you
must
indeed
go
and
see
Mr.
Bingley
when
he
comes
into
the
neighbourhood."
"It
is
more
than
I
engage
for,
I
assure
you."
"But
consider
your
daughters.
Only
think
what
an
establishment
it
would
be
for
one
of
them.
Sir
William
and
Lady
Lucas
are
determined
to
go,
merely
on
that
account,
for
in
general,
you
know,
they
visit
no
newcomers.
Indeed
you
must
go,
for
it
will
be
impossible
for
_us_
to
visit
him
if
you
do
not."
"You
are
over-scrupulous,
surely.
I
dare
say
Mr.
Bingley
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you;
and
I
will
send
a
few
lines
by
you
to
assure
him
of
my
hearty
consent
to
his
marrying
whichever
he
chooses
of
the
girls;
though
I
must
throw
in
a
good
word
for
my
little
Lizzy."
"I
desire
you
will
do
no
such
thing.
Lizzy
is
not
a
bit
better
than
the
others;
and
I
am
sure
she
is
not
half
so
handsome
as
Jane,
nor
half
so
good-humoured
as
Lydia.
But
you
are
always
giving
_her_
the
preference."
"They
have
none
of
them
much
to
recommend
them."
replied
he;
"they
are
all
silly
and
ignorant
like
other
girls;
but
Lizzy
has
something
more
of
quickness
than
her
sisters."
"Mr.
Bennet,
how
_can_
you
abuse
your
own
children
in
such
a
way?
You
take
delight
in
vexing
me.
You
have
no
compassion
for
my
poor
nerves."
"You
mistake
me,
my
dear.
I
have
a
high
respect
for
your
nerves.
They
are
my
old
friends.
I
have
heard
you
mention
them
with
consideration
these
last
twenty
years
at
least."
"Ah,
you
do
not
know
what
I
suffer."
"But
I
hope
you
will
get
over
it,
and
live
to
see
many
young
men
of
four
thousand
a
year
come
into
the
neighbourhood."
"It
will
be
no
use
to
us,
if
twenty
such
should
come,
since
you
will
not
visit
them."
"Depend
upon
it,
my
dear,
that
when
there
are
twenty,
I
will
visit
them
all."
Mr.
Bennet
was
so
odd
a
mixture
of
quick
parts,
sarcastic
humour,
reserve,
and
caprice,
that
the
experience
of
three-and-twenty
years
had
been
insufficient
to
make
his
wife
understand
his
character.
_Her_
mind
was
less
difficult
to
develop.
She
was
a
woman
of
mean
understanding,
little
information,
and
uncertain
temper.
When
she
was
discontented,
she
fancied
herself
nervous.
The
business
of
her
life
was
to
get
her
daughters
married;
its
solace
was
visiting
and
news.
Bennet
was
among
the
earliest
of
those
who
waited
on
Mr.
Bingley.
He
had
always
intended
to
visit
him,
though
to
the
last
always
assuring
his
wife
that
he
should
not
go;
and
till
the
evening
after
the
visit
was
paid
she
had
no
knowledge
of
it.
It
was
then
disclosed
in
the
following
manner.
Observing
his
second
daughter
employed
in
trimming
a
hat,
he
suddenly
addressed
her
with:
"I
hope
Mr.
Bingley
will
like
it,
Lizzy."
"We
are
not
in
a
way
to
know
_what_
Mr.
Bingley
likes."
said
her
mother
resentfully,
"since
we
are
not
to
visit."
"But
you
forget,
mamma."
said
Elizabeth,
"that
we
shall
meet
him
at
the
assemblies,
and
that
Mrs.
Long
promised
to
introduce
him."
"I
do
not
believe
Mrs.
Long
will
do
any
such
thing.
She
has
two
nieces
of
her
own.
She
is
a
selfish,
hypocritical
woman,
and
I
have
no
opinion
of
her."
"No
more
have
I."
said
Mr.
Bennet;
"and
I
am
glad
to
find
that
you
do
not
depend
on
her
serving
you."
Mrs.
Bennet
deigned
not
to
make
any
reply,
but,
unable
to
contain
herself,
began
scolding
one
of
her
daughters.
"Don't
keep
coughing
so,
Kitty,
for
Heaven's
sake!
Have
a
little
compassion
on
my
nerves.
You
tear
them
to
pieces."
"Kitty
has
no
discretion
in
her
coughs."
said
her
father;
"she
times
them
ill."
"I
do
not
cough
for
my
own
amusement."
replied
Kitty
fretfully.
"When
is
your
next
ball
to
be,
Lizzy?"
"To-morrow
fortnight."
"Aye,
so
it
is."
cried
her
mother,
"and
Mrs.
Long
does
not
come
back
till
the
day
before;
so
it
will
be
impossible
for
her
to
introduce
him,
for
she
will
not
know
him
herself."
"Then,
my
dear,
you
may
have
the
advantage
of
your
friend,
and
introduce
Mr.
Bingley
to
_her_."
"Impossible,
Mr.
Bennet,
impossible,
when
I
am
not
acquainted
with
him
myself;
how
can
you
be
so
teasing?"
"I
honour
your
circumspection.
A
fortnight's
acquaintance
is
certainly
very
little.
One
cannot
know
what
a
man
really
is
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight.
But
if
_we_
do
not
venture
somebody
else
will;
and
after
all,
Mrs.
Long
and
her
neices
must
stand
their
chance;
and,
therefore,
as
she
will
think
it
an
act
of
kindness,
if
you
decline
the
office,
I
will
take
it
on
myself."
The
girls
stared
at
their
father.
Mrs.
Bennet
said
only,
"Nonsense,
nonsense."
"What
can
be
the
meaning
of
that
emphatic
exclamation?"
cried
he.
"Do
you
consider
the
forms
of
introduction,
and
the
stress
that
is
laid
on
them,
as
nonsense?
I
cannot
quite
agree
with
you
_there_.
What
say
you,
Mary?
For
you
are
a
young
lady
of
deep
reflection,
I
know,
and
read
great
books
and
make
extracts."
Mary
wished
to
say
something
sensible,
but
knew
not
how.
"While
Mary
is
adjusting
her
ideas."
he
continued,
"let
us
return
to
Mr.
Bingley."
"I
am
sick
of
Mr.
Bingley."
cried
his
wife.
"I
am
sorry
to
hear
_that_;
but
why
did
not
you
tell
me
that
before?
If
I
had
known
as
much
this
morning
I
certainly
would
not
have
called
on
him.
It
is
very
unlucky;
but
as
I
have
actually
paid
the
visit,
we
cannot
escape
the
acquaintance
now."
The
astonishment
of
the
ladies
was
just
what
he
wished;
that
of
Mrs.
Bennet
perhaps
surpassing
the
rest;
though,
when
the
first
tumult
of
joy
was
over,
she
began
to
declare
that
it
was
what
she
had
expected
all
the
while.
"How
good
it
was
in
you,
my
dear
Mr.
Bennet!
But
I
knew
I
should
persuade
you
at
last.
I
was
sure
you
loved
your
girls
too
well
to
neglect
such
an
acquaintance.
Well,
how
pleased
I
am!
and
it
is
such
a
good
joke,
too,
that
you
should
have
gone
this
morning
and
never
said
a
word
about
it
till
now."
"Now,
Kitty,
you
may
cough
as
much
as
you
choose."
said
Mr.
Bennet;
and,
as
he
spoke,
he
left
the
room,
fatigued
with
the
raptures
of
his
wife.
"What
an
excellent
father
you
have,
girls."
said
she,
when
the
door
was
shut.
"I
do
not
know
how
you
will
ever
make
him
amends
for
his
kindness;
or
me,
either,
for
that
matter.
At
our
time
of
life
it
is
not
so
pleasant,
I
can
tell
you,
to
be
making
new
acquaintances
every
day;
but
for
your
sakes,
we
would
do
anything.
Lydia,
my
love,
though
you
_are_
the
youngest,
I
dare
say
Mr.
Bingley
will
dance
with
you
at
the
next
ball."
"Oh."
said
Lydia
stoutly,
"I
am
not
afraid;
for
though
I
_am_
the
youngest,
I'm
the
tallest."
The
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
conjecturing
how
soon
he
would
return
Mr.
Bennet's
visit,
and
determining
when
they
should
ask
him
to
dinner.
Bennet,
however,
with
the
assistance
of
her
five
daughters,
could
ask
on
the
subject,
was
sufficient
to
draw
from
her
husband
any
satisfactory
description
of
Mr.
Bingley.
They
attacked
him
in
various
ways--with
barefaced
questions,
ingenious
suppositions,
and
distant
surmises;
but
he
eluded
the
skill
of
them
all,
and
they
were
at
last
obliged
to
accept
the
second-hand
intelligence
of
their
neighbour,
Lady
Lucas.
Her
report
was
highly
favourable.
Sir
William
had
been
delighted
with
him.
He
was
quite
young,
wonderfully
handsome,
extremely
agreeable,
and,
to
crown
the
whole,
he
meant
to
be
at
the
next
assembly
with
a
large
party.
Nothing
could
be
more
delightful!
To
be
fond
of
dancing
was
a
certain
step
towards
falling
in
love;
and
very
lively
hopes
of
Mr.
Bingley's
heart
were
entertained.
"If
I
can
but
see
one
of
my
daughters
happily
settled
at
Netherfield."
said
Mrs.
Bennet
to
her
husband,
"and
all
the
others
equally
well
married,
I
shall
have
nothing
to
wish
for."
In
a
few
days
Mr.
Bingley
returned
Mr.
Bennet's
visit,
and
sat
about
ten
minutes
with
him
in
his
library.
He
had
entertained
hopes
of
being
admitted
to
a
sight
of
the
young
ladies,
of
whose
beauty
he
had
heard
much;
but
he
saw
only
the
father.
The
ladies
were
somewhat
more
fortunate,
for
they
had
the
advantage
of
ascertaining
from
an
upper
window
that
he
wore
a
blue
coat,
and
rode
a
black
horse.
An
invitation
to
dinner
was
soon
afterwards
dispatched;
and
already
had
Mrs.
Bennet
planned
the
courses
that
were
to
do
credit
to
her
housekeeping,
when
an
answer
arrived
which
deferred
it
all.
Mr.
Bingley
was
obliged
to
be
in
town
the
following
day,
and,
consequently,
unable
to
accept
the
honour
of
their
invitation,
etc.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
quite
disconcerted.
She
could
not
imagine
what
business
he
could
have
in
town
so
soon
after
his
arrival
in
Hertfordshire;
and
she
began
to
fear
that
he
might
be
always
flying
about
from
one
place
to
another,
and
never
settled
at
Netherfield
as
he
ought
to
be.
Lady
Lucas
quieted
her
fears
a
little
by
starting
the
idea
of
his
being
gone
to
London
only
to
get
a
large
party
for
the
ball;
and
a
report
soon
followed
that
Mr.
Bingley
was
to
bring
twelve
ladies
ladies
